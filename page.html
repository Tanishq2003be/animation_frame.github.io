        <h2 class="section-title">Ideation</h2>
        The idea for creating a landscape is inspired by nature and the beauty of natural landscapes. One evening, as the sun begins to set and birds are flying in the sky, we notice how the colors of the sky change, creating a stunning display of light and shadow.
        This experience of witnessing the beauty of nature throughout the day inspires us to create an animation that captures these moments, showcasing the natural beauty of the world around us. We want to show the natural beauty through our animation.
        Nature is always changing, and each moment is unique and beautiful. We want to capture these fleeting moments and share them with others.

        <h2 class="section-title">Challenges</h2>
        <h3>1. Flapping Bird Wings:</h3>
        Implementing realistic bird animations, including the flapping of wings, posed a significant technical challenge. This involved creating a smooth and natural-looking animation sequence that synced with the bird's flight trajectory. Key aspects of this
        challenge included designing a dynamic animation system that accurately simulates the movement of bird wings based on factors such as wind speed, altitude, and wing morphology, as well as developing algorithms for interpolating between keyframes
        to achieve smooth and fluid motion, while also ensuring that the animation remains responsive to user input or environmental changes. Optimizing the animation code to maintain consistent frame rates across different devices and screen resolutions
        was also crucial.

        <h3>2. Setting Coordinates for Different Objects:</h3>
        Positioning and aligning various objects within the WebGL scene also presented its own set of challenges. This aspect required careful consideration of spatial coordinates and transformations, including understanding and working with different coordinate
        systems, such as world space, local space, and screen space, to accurately position objects relative to each other and the camera. Managing the hierarchical relationship between different objects in the scene, such as mountains, birds, and the
        sun, was essential to ensure proper placement and alignment. Additionally, implementing dynamic object placement and movement, such as randomizing the positions of trees or birds within predefined regions of the scene, while still maintaining
        coherence and avoiding collisions, added complexity. Moreover, incorporating collision detection algorithms to prevent objects from intersecting with each other or the terrain, especially in dynamic or interactive scenes where objects may move
        or change position over time, was crucial for the overall realism and user experience of the project.

        <h2 class="section-title">Overcoming</h2>
        <h3>1. Precise Object Placement</h3>
        Manage coordinate systems effectively to accurately position objects within the scene. Create dynamic placement algorithms considering environmental constraints and user interactions. Iterate through testing and refinement to fine-tune placement algorithms.


        <h3>2. Hit and Trial</h3>
        Experiment with different animation parameters, interpolation techniques, and object placement algorithms through iterative testing. Solicit user feedback and make adjustments accordingly. Utilize a trial-and-error approach to refine the project's visual
        fidelity and performance.
